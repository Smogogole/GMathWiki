Induction is a proving technique that states the following:

> [!quote] Notion: Induction
> If a property $P$ is true for $n=0$ and the truth of the property for $k$ implies the truth of the property for $k+1$ we have that the property $P$ is true for all $n\in \mathbb N$

This proving technique is axiomatized through the [[Peano axioms]]. If one considers the [[Well ordering of the natural numbers]] and takes it on as an [[Axioms|axiom]] then induction can also be proved.
