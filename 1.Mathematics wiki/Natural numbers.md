Formally speaking the natural numbers is a [[Sets|set]] defined by one of the [[ZF-axioms]], the axiom of infinity  

> [!quote] Definition: Natural numbers
> There exists a set $\mathbb{N}$, whose elements are called natural numbers, as well as an object $0$ in $\mathbb{N}$, and an object $S(n)$ assigned to every natural number $n âˆˆ \mathbb{N}$, such that the [[Peano axioms]] hold.

Under [[Addition|addition]] and [[Multiplication|multiplication]] the natural numbers form a [[Semiring|semiring]]
