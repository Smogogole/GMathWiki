> [!quote] Definition: Upper and lower triangle matrices
> Let $A\in M_{m\times n}(F)$, we say that $A$ is a upper triangle matrix if and if $$ \forall 1\leq i\leq m\; \forall 1\leq j\leq n,\; j<i\implies (A)_{ij}=0 $$Similarly $A$ is said to be a lower triangle matrix if and only if $$   \forall 1\leq i\leq m\; \forall 1\leq j\leq n,\; i<j\implies (A)_{ij}=0$$
