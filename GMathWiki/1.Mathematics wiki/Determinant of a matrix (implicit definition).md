> [!quote] Definition: Determinant of a matrix (implicit definition)
> The determinant function $$ \text{det}:M_{n\times n}(F)\to F $$ Is the unique function that satisfies the following three conditions given some $A\in M_{n\times n}(F)$:
> 1. $\det(\mathbb{I}_{n})=1$
> 2. $\det(C_{ij}A)=-\det (A)$
> 3. $\det$ is multilinear over the rows of $A$
> 
>Where $C_{ij}$ is the row switching elementary matrix.
