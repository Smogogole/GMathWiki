The Peano axioms are a set of [[Axioms|axioms]] used to construct the [[Natural numbers|natural numbers]]. They describe the fundamental properties of $\mathbb N$.

> [!quote] Notion: Peano axioms
> 1. $0\in\mathbb N$ 
> 2. $n\in\mathbb N\implies S(n)\in \mathbb N$
> 3. $\forall n\in \mathbb N:S(n)\neq 0$
> 4. $S$ is an injection
> 5. Let $P(n)$ be any property pertaining to a natural number $n$. Suppose that $P(0)$ is true, and suppose that whenever $P(n)$ is true, $P(S(n))$ is also true. Then $P(n)$ is true for every natural number $n$.

Where $S(n)$ denotes the [[Successor function|successor function]] and the fifth axiom is a description of [[Induction]].
