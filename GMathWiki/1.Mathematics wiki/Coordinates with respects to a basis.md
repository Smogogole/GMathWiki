Types: %%_Objects/notions of type `object`/`notion` with additional restrictions._%% 
Examples: %%_Specific examples or counterexamples of `object`/`notion` (but not of any of its `types`)._%%
Construction: %%_Objects/notions derived from `object`/`notion`._%%
Generalization: %%_Abstractions of `object`/`notion`._%%

Properties: %%_Statements regarding `object` or necessary conditions of `notion`._%%
Sufficiencies: %%_Proofs that other objects are of type `object` or sufficient conditions of `notion`._%%
Equivalences: %%_Equivalent definitions for `object` or biconditionals between notions and `notion`._%%

We generalize the notion of a coordinate system as follows:

> [!quote] Notion: Coordinates with respects to a basis
> Given a vector $v \in V$ and a basis $E$ we know that there exist unique scalars $\lambda \in F$ such that: $$v=\sum^{\text{card}(E)}_{i=1}\lambda_{i} e_{i}$$ The ordered pair $(\lambda_{i})_{1\leq i\leq \text{card}(E)}$ is said to be the coordinate of $v$ with respects to $E$.
