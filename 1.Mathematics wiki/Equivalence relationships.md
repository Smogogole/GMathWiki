Suppose $R$ is a relation on a set $A$. Then $R$ is called an equivalence relation on $A$(or just an equivalence relation if $A$ is clear from context) if:

> [!quote] Definition: Equivalence relation
> 1. $R$ is reflexive: $\forall a\in A: aRa$ or equivalently $\forall a\in A: (a,a)\in R$
> 2. $R$ is symmetric: $\forall a,b\in A: aRb\implies bRa$ or equivalently $\forall a,b\in A: (a,b)\in R\implies (b,a)\in R$
> 3. $R$ is transitive: $\forall a,b,c\in A: aRb\land bRc\implies aRc$ or equivalently $\forall a,b,c\in A: (a,b)\in R\land (b,c)\in R\implies (a,c)\in R$

From this also flows the notion of an [[Equivalence classes]]
