> [!quote] Definition: Linear map
> A linear map is a function $T$ from a vector space $V$ to a vector space $W$, both which are defined over a [[Fields|field]] $F$, that satisfies:$$
\begin{align} 
T(v+w)&=T(v)+T(w)\\
T(av)&=aT(v)
\end{align}
$$Or simply: $$ T(av+bw)=aT(v)+bT(w)
$$

If $T$ is [[Functions|bijective]] we say that $T$ is a [[Isomorphisms|isomorphism]] between vector spaces.
