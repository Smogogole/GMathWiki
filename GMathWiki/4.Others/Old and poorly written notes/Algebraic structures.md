An algebraic structure consists of a nonempty [[Sets|set]] $A$ (called the underlying set, carrier set or domain), a collection of [[Operations|operations]] on $A$ (typically [[Binary operations|binary operations]]), and a finite set of identities, known as axioms, that these operations must satisfy.
