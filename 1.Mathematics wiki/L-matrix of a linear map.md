> [!quote] Definition: L-matrix of a linear map
> Let $V,W$ be some finite dimensional $F$-vector spaces with bases $\beta_{V}$ and $\beta_{W}$ respectively and $L:V\to W$ a linear map, then the associated $L$-matrix is the unique $A\in M_{\dim W\times \dim V}(F)$ such that $$ \text{co}_{\beta_{W}}\circ L=  A\circ \text{co}_{\beta_{V}} $$
> We often write this matrix $L^{\beta_{W}}_{\beta_{V}}$.
