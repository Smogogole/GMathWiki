We define a basis as follows:

> [!quote] Notion: Basis of a vector space
> Given a vector space $V$ and $V' \subseteq V$ we say $V'$ forms a basis of $V$ if and only  if: $$ \text{Span}(V')=V \land V' \; \text{are all linearly independant}$$

Proving every [[Vector spaces|vector space]] has a basis turns out to be non trivial, requiring [[Zorn's lemma]] and [[Axiom of choice]].
